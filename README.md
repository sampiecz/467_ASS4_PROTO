# Need to do / Verify we have
## These are notes I took while at the TA's office hours.
- [x] Login event manager
- [x] Event staff
- [x] CO
- [x] One dropdown
- [ ] Three different dashboard
- [ ] Event staff will have create artist band and agent
- [ ] Event manager will have approve event and detailed report
- [ ] Coo login will have the summary report. 
- [ ] How do we add multiple band members inside the form? Probably jQuery. 
- [ ] Coo login will have the summary report. 
- [ ] Create table attribuites for Event
- [ ] Link any PHP to the database and process any form to the database
- [ ] Check for submit buttons and all buttons needed to navigate 
- [ ] Add Agent to the same page as Create Artist/Band
- [ ] Why would we right justify labels? Humans read right to left. That would just be bad UX. 
- [ ] Add bandId & possibly agentId inside of create_a_new_band.php
