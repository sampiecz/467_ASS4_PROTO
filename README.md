### Need to do / Verify we have
#### These are notes I took while at the TA's office hours.
- [x] Login event manager
- [x] Event staff
- [x] CO
- [x] One dropdown
- [X] Event Staff, COO, and Event Manager can generate summary report (specific date range) List event by status (How many tickets have been sold so far and monitor the expected revenue from ticket sale)  
- [ ] How many tickets have been sold in order to 30% commision
- [X] Three different dashboard
- [X] Event staff will have create artist band and agent
- [X] Event manager will have approve event and detailed report
- [X] Coo login will have the summary report. 
- [X] Create table attribuites for Event
- [X] Link any PHP to the database and process any form to the database
- [X] Check for submit buttons and all buttons needed to navigate 
- [X] Add Agent to the same page as Create Artist/Band
- [X] Why would we right justify labels? Humans read right to left. That would just be bad UX. 
- [X] Add modal popup for agent creation on artist creation page in case the agent isn't in dropdown 
- [X] Create Agent Table and find out what attributes are needed to store it 
- [X] Add bandId & possibly agentId inside of create_a_new_band.php
- [X] Add messages / form validation to things. Will make Kai all happy and give us a better grade. Woo. 
- [X] Add php for dropdown band / artist on create_a_new_event  
- [X] Once again, Kai loves messages and validation. 
- [X] Add datepicker to generate summary report
